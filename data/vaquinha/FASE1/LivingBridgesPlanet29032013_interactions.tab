The host was Atlet Century Hotel in Jakarta_ and 250 participants were in attendance from across the glob._Underpinning the conference_ was the focus on creating settings where young people can interact_ share and challenge each other to create an international committed to dynamic life long and experiential learning to face the many challenges. Central to the conference was the recognition of adults that would uplift the spirits of young people through mentorship. _ To date three conferences of such magnitude have been held and the themes were as followed;_a) June 2001      “Educating our Human Future”                             Jakarta_ Indonesia_b) August 2003   “Learning to live Personally Sustainable Life”      Colorado_ USA_c) July 2006        “Rethinking Educational Change”                          Infrane_ Morocco_It is from the above exposure_ experience_ training and mentorship that Mr. Munyaradzi Muzenda an active youth worker from Zimbabwe was inspired to implement the project called AFRICA SPEAKS. Mr. Hugh Lynn_ of New Zealand and who was a staff member during the Vittachi Conference has been mentoring and standing by Mr. Muzenda’s country and regional projects ever since. _Mr. Muzenda has been enabled to Network with all the SADC and Eastern African nations through which Africa Speaks has created a resource of leadership and resourceful creative arts programs. Africa Speaks focuses on building awareness among young people in Africa and in the Diaspora to celebrate being African and envision the beauty_ heritage and sustaining the future of Africa. _The main objectives of Africa Speaks are;_a) To market and promote the beauty_ heritage and cultures of Africans using the gifts and the an untapped talents of its young people._b) To deal with prejudices conduct awareness_ and convince the world about the true reality of the African Continent._c) To develop and record an accurate African story as seen in the eyes of its young men and women._d) To facilitate Enterprise Development Programs among young people in Africa.__With the support from Mr. Hugh Lynn_ a mentor_ and resource mobilization by country leadership_ six events have been held has followed;_a) October 2001      “1st Africa Speaks Conference”                                      Great Zimbabwe_ Masvingo_b) September 2002  “Strategic Planning Workshop”                                  Kariba_ Zambia/Zimbabwe_c) July 2004             “Applying Best Practices in Cotton Production”          Mumbwa_ Zambia_d) December 2004      “2st Africa Speaks Conference”                                Marondera_  Zimbabwe_e) March 2013              “Moving Arts Planning  Meeting”                          Lusaka_ Zambia_f) March 2013             “The Power of Moving Arts in Leadership”             Matero_ Zambia_ The driving force for Africa Speaks is the works of Guerrand Hermes Foundation for Peace_ Dr. Varindra Vittachi_ Dr. Kwame Nkrumah_ Dr. Kenneth Kaunda_ Mr. Nelson Madiba Mandela_ Professor Mazoroi_ and many such activists_ revolutionaries who made Africa be rebated and  protected from extinction of its cultures_ beliefs and values. _ISSUE ANALYSIS_Recent years have witnessed dramatic changes and influences in the lives of young people in Africa_ as elsewhere in across continents. Changes in livelihoods_ cultural practices_ technology transfer_ and shifts in the nature of family and intimate relationships_ have combined to make transitions to adulthood more diverse_ complex and unequal than in previous generations. The negative impact on these developments needs governments to respond efficiently and effectively to the needs of young people. _The changing experiences of youth has contributed to the transformation in ways of thinking about and organizing services and programs for young people. As out lined in the Commonwealth Youth Policy_ The UNESCO_ the National Youth Policies and the Youth Chatters all advocate for the participation and embracing the rights of young people as key elements of the world development equation. For example_ the African Youth Chatter does not only provide the Governments_ Youth_ and Civil Society and International Partners with continental framework_ which underpins the rights_ duties_ and freedoms of youth. It also paves the way for development of national programs and strategic plans for youth empowerment. _However_ Africa Governments have had challenges to meeting all the needs of young people due to numerous factors. These factors arise from such influences as changes in the political landscape_ inadequate human resources_ inadequate resources to reach all the needs of young people_ corruption and many others.  _Young people have continued to lead impoverished livelihoods. The situation of young people is a breathing social volcano that will soon or later explode to an uncontrollable scale. Africa Speaks is determined to contribute to African Governments strategies to engage young people in productive programs that will use Art and Cultural promotions as a vehicle to sustainability and uplifting the African spirit of belonging and existence. The promotion of MOVING ARTS will review the untold story of Africa._THE PROJECT__The main purpose of Afrika Speaks International Moving Arts_ Festival_ Exhibition and Celebrations PROJECT  is to cover African countries “affectionately to be known as The African Adventure”_ targeting  Uganda_ Kenya_ Tanzania_ Zambia_ Zimbabwe_ Botswana and South Africa.__TARGET__Young people of Africa__THE OBJECTIVES__1)  To market and promote the natural beauty_ heritage and culture of Africa and its people.__2)  To identify_ develop and promote skills and talents among the African young people so that they   _      Can reach their full potential.__ Key result areas:__(i) To promote an enabling environment that allow young people globally grow towards their full potential_(ii) To identify and promote talent amongst young people in Africa_(iii) To develop and document professionally the true African story._(iv) To develop and strengthen relationship_ friendships and partnership at all 3 levels(individual_ country and continent)_(v) To foster unity_ peace_ dialogue and understanding between Africa and the rest of the World._(vi) To exchange information and share experiences between Africa_ Europe and Asia._(vii) To deal with real life issues_ and challenges facing visionaries_ talented and gifted young people and the continent at large_(viii) To turn stories_ visions and dreams into potent_ accessible_ large scale live ad media performances that entertain while also affecting/touching the minds and souls of young and adults audiences_(ix) To nurture youth talents and voices_ by providing them will tools to speak the unspoken side of Africa_ address issues of relevance to them and all of us.__PROJECT PHYLOSOPHY__Africa Nations need to develop and showcase a true African Story and a Journey based on the following key points/headlines/topics as young people tour selected countries in which poets_ musicians_ story tellers_ photographers_ short documentaries etc. must produce cultural products focusing on the following:__a) The rich natural beauty_ heritage and culture of the African continent_b) Gentleness and humility of the African people _c) Beauty and wealth of African Arts and culture_d) Vibrancy and energy of the African Youth_e) Abundance of natural resources_f) Immensity of the potential of the Africa_g) A united people	2013-03-29T09:49:22+0000	0	1	1

We know that you love solving problems too. __Dr. Howard Rasheed_ a professor at University of North Carolina who specializes in innovation_ has come up with a method for group idea creation. __The process is simple. You start with two or more relevant trends and you discuss them to develop possible opportunities. __You then list the opportunities and discuss their viability based on everyone_s collective knowledge and come up with an idea.__Let_s do it! We are going to use the GeniusCorps_ Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/pages/GeniusCorps/239009589538217) to identify ideas that will change the world. Once they are developed by the group anyone can own them and build from them.__Yep!! Vetted_ ideas for great innovation that you can just pick up and start working on. The cool thing is you will already have an established beta test group in the co-creators of the idea.__So this is how it will go. Every week we will post a new set of trends. We will discuss the opportunities from those trends and like the comments that we want to see turn into opportunities.__The next day we will post the most liked opportunity and discuss ideas. like the idea that you believe is most doable. __Simple idea co-creation courtesy of Dr. Rasheed_s idea accelerator.	2013-03-13T11:51:35+0000	0	3	3

264044860368840_346676428772349	status	AN APPEAL TO CARDINALS TO LOOK FOR LAY POPE TO IMPROVE THE VATICAN__Warm Greetings and Namaste._Vatican conclave to elect a new Pope will begin on Tuesday_ March 12_ 2013. There will be total media black out during election_ that is_ till the new Pope gets 2/3rd majority or 77 votes and _the faithful_ see the white smoke that represents white manipulations in the Papal Election. It is this secrecy which has kept the Papacy Euro Centric. Like in the USA_ no President can be elected without the Zionist mafia_s tacit support_ the Pope cannot be elected if he is not White. This White Plague has to end for the world to progress.__This year an African (or Black Pope) was expected to win. In fact_ he was the hot favourite of the bookies. But it looks like he has already been sidelined.__But no one can sideline a Brown Learned Pope from India_ whose name is Dr. Leo Rebello_ whose name people from all over the world have recommended as per the Canon Law_ _Any Catholic man in good standing can be elected pope_. So_ if you wish to save the Church_ the biggest institution in the world_ it is about time_ you will include my name in the list of Papal Candidates_ and leave the rest to the Divine. Together_ I appeal_ that let us save this otherwise dying institution.__In Freethought Archives_ if you Google search_ you come across so many derogatory comments about the Vatican. In a book titled Crimes of Christianity by G.W.Foote & J.M.Wheeler_ there is a chapter that deals with the Crimes of the Popes (chapter VII).__Here is a damning opening paragraph from that chapter: _WE now give a rapid summary of the crimes and vices with which many of the popes disgraced the chair of St. Peter; and before we conclude_ the reader will see that every villainy has been practiced by the vicegerents of God. Peculation_ theft_ cruelty_ murder_ fornication_ adultery_ and incest_ not to mention still darker crimes_ have all been notoriously committed by the supreme rulers of Christendom_ who sat in the seat of infallibility_ and claimed universal jurisdiction over the thoughts and consciences of mankind_.__And here are other short observations from the said chapter with my comments.__* So_ there was Pope Leo (440-61) who later became St. Leo the Great_ after whom_ my parents named me since I was born on April 11. He was known as _insolent and persecuting Pope_. Maybe_ I am reborn to wash my _Karma_ and improve the Church from insolence to understanding_ from persecution to embracing everyone with love_ from Christendom to unification of all sects and religions in Brotherhood (which Christ taught).__* Then there was St. Hormisdas (514-23). _He was a married man_ and had a son__ like I am also married and have one son. So_ just because I am married_ I cannot be debarred.__* When Stephen III (768-72) was elected_ he found on the pontifical throne a lay pope_ one Constantine_ who_ after a violent struggle_ was dislodged and punished with the loss of his eyes; many of his friends sharing the same fate. So_ Vatican history_ sordid as it may be_ proves that Lay Pope_ Married Pope can be appointed.__* After discussing a long list of debauch_ murderers_ maniacs_ deviant Popes_ finally the authors G.W.Foote & J.M.Wheeler conclude: _We now close this horrid list of criminals. Since the Reformation the popes have been obliged to live more decently_ or at least to conceal their vices instead of flaunting them before the world_.__* My son Robin (who is an actor) was shocked by these gory accounts and commented: _Daddy_ why do you wish to go into such a Den of Devils?_. I said to my son_ _For I am sent down by the Heavenly Father to clean the Church and to make it the Universal Church open to all_ for God is One_.__In fact_ with my fresh views and vast grassroots and international experience (lectures in 65 countries)_ 41 books written (scholarship)_ leadership qualities_ and world vision_ this is the right time_ God-notified time_ to appoint me to that august chair and together let us clean the Augean_s stable_ like Hercules did_ is my Appeal to all 115 cardinals and the world Catholics_ including all other Christian denominations.__Otherwise_ according to prophesies and predictions_ the New Pope will be the Last Pope_ because the 99% Catholics will revolt what with 99% occupation movement gathering momentum. So_ I am the best bet for the dying Church for its reformation...__My agenda to revive the Roman Catholic Church is:-_1.. Priests and Nuns will be allowed to marry. This will reduce to a large extent_ homosexual crimes_ abortion among nuns_ pedophilia_ drug abuse_ etc.__2.. Female priests will be ordained to put an end to Patriarchy in next one decade. Matriarchal society is motherly society. After my term gets over_ and I may resign like Pope Benedict_ who blessed me_ when I met him in 2006_ having improved the Vatican to give chance to others.__3.. Vatican will not indulge in money laundering or not invest in pharmaceutical_ arms and banking... Instead_ it will have a separate World Christian Bank and Jewish banking system based on usury will be shut down like Jesus Christ had broken their benches_ from which the word bankrupt has come.__4.. Church will build bridges with book brothers and step brothers_ Muslims_ so that peace prevails in the world. This racial profiling of Muslims as being terrorists when the real terrorists are somewhere else and manipulation of the world has to end. From a barbaric history to history of civilised human beings is the goal.__5.. From superior Indian culture_ which is light years ahead of the world in all sectors_ including _World is Family_ vision_ which is shared as _Ubuntu__ _We are the World__ _Globalisation__ _One World_ etc. which are central to Christian philosophy.__6.. Since_ I am a Holistic Healer_ with my new Holistic Development idiom_ with Possiblica Management theory_ we will be able to bring about Happiness Index_ leading to annihilation of poverty_ abolishing slavery of any kind including child labour_ women_s exploitation_ elimination of drugs_ banning of death sentence and wars_ private prisons and animal sacrifices_ borderless world with no terrorism_ one world currency_ one world Parliament_ and eternal religion [based on Universal Love_ fearless spirit and the Brotherhood Teachings of Jesus Christ and Vedic (old testament) philosophy of world family_ not being different] will unite the world.__7.. In short_ Holistic Plan_ Holistic Development_ Peace and Plenty for all. God has provided enough for everyone in this world_ but the insatiable greed of the few has tilted the world toward damnation. This has to change and we must all Work for Change and Right the Wrongs.__In conclusion: All 115 Cardinals are_ hereby_ requested to meditate on NOT only what I have recorded above Accurately_ Briefly and Clearly_ but also the following candid observation of John L. Allen Jr. of Rome who writes in an article entitled _Who Will Be the Next Pope?_: Prognostication is a notoriously hazardous business_ and the trash heaps of church history are littered with the carcasses of journalists who have tried to predict the next pope. Almost no one_ for example_ correctly anticipated that the archbishop of Kraków_ Karol Wojtyla_ would emerge from the second conclave of 1978 as Pope John Paul II.__Now is the turn of Dr. Leo Rebello of India to emerge as the Next Pope_ with original message of Jesus Christ delivered on the Mount. And that message is _Save my Church_.	2013-03-12T17:04:49+0000	0	0	0

264044860368840_346478118792180	status	Traditional schools train people to achieve specific goals_ to integrate into an existing  professional environment. It is based on individual excellence and competitiveness. The school of the future must prepare people to create their own professional horizon in a world that is rapidly changing and making many of the traditional teachings obsolete. This new education is based on collaborative thinking as opposed to individualistic competitiveness_ it will encourage creativity and personal spiritual fulfillment as opposed to only material and professional achievements. It is a holistic approach to education not a traditional subject based curriculum. It focuses on relational information and practical experimentation not traditional theoretical knowledge. The school of the future needs to develop a new human being because the important question we ask is: who do we want to be? what kind of humanity do we want to prepare? As we answer these questions_ we understand the need for a balanced approach between work and non-work_ between the material experience and the spiritual and intangible component of living.	2013-03-11T23:47:03+0000	0	3	3

While the Assam Rifles personnel who killed 10 civilians have not been arrested.__The flaws in the Iron Lady_s case are: _1.. Fasting is not starvation. _2.. Fasting for Health and for a cause like Humanising the Army or Society is not a crime. _3.. Irom Sharmila inspite of 12 years fast has not died and as she said she has no intention of dying. So_ the charge _attempt to suicide_ is mindless. _4.. And if she can be charged for attempting suicide_ then the Authorities too should be charged for abetting or force feeding her through a tube_ because force feeding is the worst assault on her body -- it is akin to Rape. _5.. Force feeding or not listening to her just demand is violation of Right to Life_ Right to Freedom of agitating peacefully to repeal the draconian act AFSPA which has turned our civilised Army into trigger crazy maniacs and rapists by misusing the said act. Army_s first duty is to protect the citizens against foreign aggression.__We support Irom Sharmila and other women who even paraded naked before the soul-dead authorities to repeal the said draconian AFSPA in their ongoing agitation for the last 12 years.__For that very reason we reject Anna Hazare_ Arvind Kejriwal_ Baba Ramdev_ Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and other so-called activists_ self-appointed saints_ and crazy retired and serving generals for supporting AFSPA. The self-appointed Gandhians like Hazare_ Kejriwal etc. infact can be arrested for misusing MK Gandhi_s name and trivializing Fast for a Cause. They too had declared that they will fast unto death_ but have been drinking fruit juices and eating curd rice while authorities have been periodically taking them to Super Specialty Hospitals for observation. Why the authorities have not arrested these Johnies under attempt to suicide?__Incidentally_ Right to Die with Dignity is part of Right to Life and Health. By giving up food intake the Jain Munis help the soul to leave the weak body. Can the Police arrest the Jain munis too for an attempt to suicide? If they cannot arrest them on the basis of Freedom of Religion/Belief etc._ then how can they discriminate Irom Sharmila?__Hereby we give some home work to the non-functioning Govt. of Mauni Baba sitting on the Red Himalaya of Govt Files full of corrupt practices:__1.. Stop this witch hunt of Irom Sharmila. Instead give her Shaurya Award for fasting for a cause to save the women of the nation for so long.__2.. Repeal the draconian Armed Forces Special Powers Act because when protectors become the devils_ then civilised society degenerates and dies.__If the Govt. does not act on this_ the Chief Justice and other Judges of the Supreme Court of India are publicly requested vide this candid post to intervene suo motu and __(a) Stop false prosecution of Irom Sharmila_ _(b) Order repeal of AFSPA forthwith. _(c) Abolish the Death Penalty. _(d) And if they are so technical that they cannot think rationally and give swift judgments like King Solomon_ then the least that they can do is _(e) Appoint me as a Jurist Judge to the Supreme Court of India_ as per the provision of the Constitution of India which has not been implemented so far and I will show how we can unclog the courts which instead of Temples of Justice have become Caves of Corruption. __Namaste.	2013-03-06T15:28:11+0000	0	1	1
