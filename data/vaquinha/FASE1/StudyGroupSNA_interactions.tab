140630009439814_150870435082438	status	# of Attempts  4/100__I_ve got 10/10 from my latest HW but honestly__1st attempt 4/10__2nd and 3rd attempt 7/10__just then I got it right :-/__Shame on me_ I didn_t manage my time well to study properly and that was the effect of it (previous HWs I_ve got 10/10 on first attempt). But my concern is not about the particular HW and that I was lazy_ rather about the number of attempts for a HW.__Isn_t 100 too much? I personally think that 3 would be just fine_ so that I_m forced to study the papers in more details. I know it_s a question of self motivation_ not punishing people ... but really think it would be better if the rules are more strict about this.__What do you think?	2013-04-03T08:33:18+0000	4	1	5

140630009439814_150005158502299	status	There is a post in the course discussion forums asking if it is possible to enter values when thresholding filters in Gephi instead of using the slider.  I_ve just replied to that post_ but for those who don_t read the course forum_ yes you can enter numbers_ and here is how to do it.__Add your filter_ for example Topology > Degree Range.__Bottom left of Gephi you_ll see the slider to threshold the graph.__Under that slider you will see a low bound number to the left and a high bound number to the right.  It isn_t at all intuitive because there no input box to change these numbers_ but if you double click the number it will become highlighted.__Now enter your desired number and hit Enter.  This works for both the low and high bound range.__Voila_ your graph is now filtered and you haven_t had to mess around with a slider trying to get the last bit of accuracy :)	2013-03-31T17:43:42+0000	3	3	6

So we will start at the person in our group who is just below passing_ and distribute the number of points they need to pass. If they have a 79_ they will get 1 point so they earn their certificate_ and the next person will take what they need from the pot of 99. We will continue through the class according to this ripple effect strategy. With this model_ those who worked hard and came closest to passing will definitely pass_ and there will be a lot of points left over for the rest. This will generate the maximum number of people earning a certificate. Nothing is wasted. There is no possible way to generate more passers than this model. Test it yourself.__If you would like to participate_ my email address to use is: mchampagne41@gmail.com__Thanks_ Maurice	2013-03-17T17:32:15+0000	6	0	6

140630009439814_144890455680436	status	For those who haven’t started on the week 3 assignment_ READ THIS:__The assignment requires each person to choose the email address of another person to submit to the professor_ and the person who gets the highest pagerank gets 100 points toward the final exam. We can trade points to achieve this. For those who haven’t started on the assignment_ I am making this offer:__For the first person who submits my email address_ I will give you 90 points_ and I get 10. If two people use my email address_ you split the 90 points so you both get 45. If three people use it_ you each get 30 points_ and so on. This way_ as many people as possible will get a great score on the final exam! (But nobody’s points will be so high that they don’t have to take the exam at all). We will make sure no one’s points get diluted by placing a cap on the number of people who can participate in receiving the points. If we win_ we will all vote on exactly what number of people should receive their points_ so everything is decided fairly. __If you come up with a better idea_ great! I just ask that you submit my email as one of your two if you want the points that I am offering. My email address to use is: mchampagne41@gmail.com__Thanks_ Maurice	2013-03-15T20:05:05+0000	10	1	11
