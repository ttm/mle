The city has not made any indication that they will remove the mausoleum containing Forrest_s body from the park nor have they told the Klan that they have to stop holding a rally every year on the anniversary of the death of Dr. King. The KKK has promised its largest rally ever_ in response to the renaming of the parks. _It_s not going to be 20 or 30__ [the Tennessee area KKK leader] said. _It_s going to be thousands of Klansmen from the whole United States coming to Memphis_ Tennessee.___Updates and exact times will be provided via the contacts listed below. We will meet from 9:am to noon at City Hall Plaza_ 125 N Main Street_ Memphis_ TN 38103_ approximately a block and a half from where the KKK will be gathering.

As mentioned_ the body of the founder of the KKK is enshrined in a huge monument in a city park. The tax payers (many of them People of Color) pay for the maintenance and upkeep on this monolith. Not only that_ the town is flooded once a year by white supremacists who flock to the monument to celebrate the life of the founder of the KKK on April 4th_ the anniversary of the death of MLK. Then there is the police brutality issue and the fact that there are no free homeless shelters in Memphis (the cheapest one is $6 per night) and then there is the slave auction block that sits in another city park across the the street from the main bus depot.

It was led by Nathan Bedford Forrest_ a slave trader and Confederate civil war general. The Klan_ through a series of “night-riding” attacks murdered tens of thousands of Black after the war_ and through the three other historical “revivals” built new Klan organizations in 1915_ 1956_ and 1978 which continued its racist crimes_ and its murder of Black_ civil rights_ labor_ and other activists. Some historians say the Klan and allied racist groups has murdered 100_000 persons since its creation.__For years_ the Klan and other racist movements have used the symbols of the Confederacy to unite its movement_ especially at the gravesite of Nathan Bedford Forrest_ Klan co-founder and its first Grand Wizard. Now_ a new movement_ the neo-Confederacy_ is seeking to restore the Klan’s bloody legacy and that of the Old South. We cannot allow that to happen_ we must build a new anti-racist/anti-colonialist movement to defeat all forms of fascism and white supremacy.__It is the cops and politicians in Memphis_ who are hand-in-hand collaborating with the “new” Confederate racists_ and we must expose and defeat them as well .So_ we are calling upon anti-racists_ labor_ civil rights_ church_ student and all other progressive social justice movements to join us in Memphis to stand up to these racists who use this park each year for ceremonies to spew their vile racist venom each year on Dr. Martin Luther king’s birthday and on other occasions. This time it is in defense of the renaming of Forrest Park to University of Tennessee Health Sciences Park by the Memphis City Council. It has taken the Memphis city government 44 years to even name a street in honor of Dr. King_ even after this was the city he was murdered in.__There is no park or street named in honor of Ida B.

She was eventually driven out of the city by the Klan and other white supremacist forces_ after torching her Black Community newspaper.__We have thus taken on the name of the Ida B.

You can drive directly to the Park_ and from downtown you can catch a trolley on the Madison Avenue line_ which goes right near the park. There have been other protests against this part_ and demanding a name change from this racist mass murderer. Now it has finally been done_ but the hated symbols in the park remain_ including the tomb of N.B. Forrest.__In 2005_ 250 primarily Memphis Black community protesters at the time of the 100th anniversary of the park_ forced its removal from downtown to its present location_ now we must shut it down completely!

9149038282_10151231362343283	link	_Here it is essential to recognize that capitalism in its monopoly stage is a system with such a high level of labor productivity that it is constantly prone to overaccumulation of capital and stagnation due to market saturation and scarcity of profitable outlets for productive investment. In order to continue to exist and to continue to reap monopolistic profit margins under these conditions it has mutated into an economy of built-in waste: both economic and ecological. Ours is a society characterized by (1) a gargantuan and ever-expanding sales effort penetrating into the structure of production itself; (2) planned obsolescence (including planned psychological obsolescence); (3) production of luxury goods for an opulent minority; (4) prodigious military and penal-state spending; and (5) the growth of a whole speculative superstructure in the form of finance_ insurance_ and real estate markets. It is a characteristic of such a system that much of the vast economic surplus of modern society shows up as economic waste built into production itself. All of this uses up enormous amounts of energy and resources and contributes to the ecological end-waste dumped on the planet. It also maximizes the toxicity of production_ since plastics and other petrochemical-based goods are more toxic as well as cheaper economically.32 It is for this reason that leading systems ecologist Howard Odum_ in a paper on Marx_ insisted that the key to addressing our environmental problem—the way to find what he elsewhere called “a prosperous way down”—necessarily involves eliminating built-in “luxury and waste.”__http://oreaddaily.blogspot.com/2012/12/capital-and-planetary-emergency.html	2012-12-15T21:43:32+0000	1	3	4

9149038282_10151170064133283	link	Yesterday I completed the posting at SCISSION of a serialization of Tom Clark_s “State and Counter Revolution: A Critical History of the Marxist Theory of the State.” At the bottom of this post you will a link to this entire work at one location in the Marxist Internet Archive where it became available this week.__Tom_ who is now deceased_ argued in the book that what has passed for a proletarian movement (communist_ socialist_ Marxist_ Marxist Leninist) is nothing of the kind. He argues that what is alleged to be a movement of_ by_ and/or for (take your pick) the proletariat is_ in fact_ a movement OF_ BY_ AND FOR the petty bourgeois. He contends this historical movement has been dominated by the petit bourgeois and has consequently acted on behalf of that class_ its interests and its privileges. He argues that the entire history of this movement_ call it Marxist_ socialist_ or communist has been nothing but a counter revolution against the interests of the proletariat.__While I do not agree with all of Tom_s conclusions_ I do believe he has made a very compelling argument. I do agree with his contention that petty bourgeois intellectuals have had a very negative impact on the working class and its emancipation. I do believe that these petty bourgeois Marxist intellectuals could do nothing but be true to their own class backgrounds and inadvertently or not work to perpetuate their privileges and work to perpetuate their domination over the working class and work to perpetuate capitalism as well.__I should note that I I was a member in the group Tom founded_ Communist Workers Group (ML)_ during parts of the 1970s. However_ I left the CWG several years before this work was written and before the research was done. In the most simple of terms_ my departure from the group was based on my belief at the time that the CWG had become too dogmatic and sectarian_ and was lacking in practical work. I also held a profoundly different view in relation to white supremacy_ white skin privilege and racism then did Tom or the CWG as a whole.__I am happy to announce that this work and others from the Communist Workers Group (ML) are now available at the Marxist Internet Archive.__http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-1a/tom-clark/index.htm	2012-11-01T20:30:43+0000	0	0	0

9149038282_10151167238618283	link	In his most definitive statement_ Dimitrov declared_ “... according to Marxist-Leninist principles_ the Soviet regime and popular democracy are two forms of one and the same rule – the rule of the working class in alliance with and at the head of the working people from town and countryside. They are two forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat...” (DSW Vol. 3_ p.352).__The fact that there were now two general forms of proletarian dictatorship was explained on the grounds that “...the road to socialism in different countries may differ_ in accordance with the historical national and other peculiarities of these countries...” (Ibid. p.154). A people’s democracy is thus “...enabled to realize the transition from capitalism to socialism_ without the establishment of a Soviet system_ through the rule of a popular democracy_ on condition that it gets “stabilized and develops_ with the aid of the USSR and other people’s democracies...” (Ibid. p.318).__Implicit in this line of reasoning is the recognition that the Soviet and parliamentary forms are not radically different after all_ and that in the end it is armed force_ not the structure of government_ that decides. In the USSR_ the rule of the CPSU ultimately rested on_ not an armed citizenry organized into Soviets_ but the Red Army apparatus. And as it turned out_ in Bulgaria and other East European countries_ the rule of the Communist Parties also rested on the Russian Red Army. __Today_ I will present the seventh installment of “State and Counter Revolution: A Critical History of the Marxist Theory of the State” by Tom Clark_ a former comrade of mine from the long departed Communist Workers Group (ML).

9149038282_10151163957553283	link	In an article written in the later part of 1905_ Lenin described the general relationship between workers and intellectuals as being that “...the intelligentsia is good at solving problems ‘in principle’_ good at drawing up plans_ good at reasoning about the need for action—while the workers act_ and transform drab theory into living reality...” (LCW Vol. 10_ p. 38). The intellectuals draw up the theoretical plans; the workers implement them. Or_ more to the point_ the petty bourgeoisie leads_ the workers follow....___... In “Left-wing” Communism_ Lenin writes that small commodity producers_ in particular the peasantry_ “...surround the proletariat on every side with a petty bourgeois atmosphere_ which permeates and corrupts the proletariat_ and constantly causes among the proletariat relapses into petty bourgeois spinelessness_ disunity_ individualism_ and alternating moods of exaltation and dejection...” (LCW Vol. 31_ p. 24). True_ the middle class surrounds the working class and corrupts it with its own narrow striving. But the most dangerous source of middle class influence lies not with the ‘innocent’ small commodity producer_ who_ after all_ is neither especially articulate nor influential_ but with the socialist intelligentsia_ which not only surrounds the workers_ but aggressively seeks to lead them.___----------Tom Clark__Today_ I will present the fifth installment of “State and Counter Revolution: A Critical History of the Marxist Theory of the State” by Tom Clark_ a former comrade of mine from the long departed Communist Workers Group (ML).

The second-generation theoreticians of the Communist International—Zinoviev_ Bukharin_ Stalin_ Radek_ Manuilsky_ Kuusenin_ Dimitrov_ and others—therefore only needed to draw on particular passages from the classic works in order to rationalize their current positions_ even if those positions directly contradicted previous Comintern lines.___----------Tom Clark__Today_ I will present the sixth installment of “State and Counter Revolution: A Critical History of the Marxist Theory of the State” by Tom Clark_ a former comrade of mine from the long departed Communist Workers Group (ML).

To have applied the same class criteria to Marx and Engels as Lenin applied to Kautsky and Plekhanov would have meant undercutting the final authority of the intelligentsia_ since if even the most theoretically advanced intellectuals were at heart ordinary opportunists_ the working class could not intelligently turn to this strata for political education and leadership.___--------------Tom Clark__Today_ I will present the fourth installment of “State and Counter Revolution: A Critical History of the Marxist Theory of the State” by Tom Clark_ a former comrade of mine from the long departed Communist Workers Group (ML).

Before 1848-51_ according to Lenin’s reasoning_ it was not possible for Marx to draw the theoretical conclusion that “smashing” was necessary. “It was not logical reasoning...”_ Lenin writes_”...but the actual experience of 1848-51_ that led to the matter being presented in this way...”(Ibid... p.409). Marx “...held strictly to the solid ground of historical experience...”(Ibid...). So much so_ in fact_ that even though he concluded in 1852 that the state must be demolished_ he did not venture to say what it should be replaced with until after the Paris Commune in 1871. Marx_ Lenin writes_ “...did not indulge in utopias; he expected the experience of the mass movement to provide the reply...”(Ibid... p.417).

9149038282_10151132791203283	link	A couple of years ago_ I think_ I read a book about how major natural disasters like big earthquakes are treated one way by the State and by Capital_ and a totally different way by working people. Working people often rally and create new forms of organization and take care of each other. The State decides there is danger of riots and the like and sends in the police/military. It was an interesting read.__The piece below by Harry Cleaver is along those lines. In the opening this work he writes_ ____When the Chinese write _crisis__ they use two characters_ one of which means _danger_ and one _opportunity_. This expression points beyond the riskiness most people usually associate with crises to the new possibilities inherent in any moment of dramatic change.____With that thought in mind_ I present for Scission_s Theoretical weekends the following (which as is so often the case is taken from libcom).__http://oreaddaily.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-uses-of-earthquake-by-harry-cleaver.html	2012-10-06T21:47:45+0000	0	0	0

9149038282_10151119854028283	link	Foxconn uprising: Chinese workers like workers everywhere are exploited by global capital and as everywhere it is only the workers themselves who have the power and ability to put an end to that exploitation. We are not talking trade unions_ or vanguard party here. We are talking worker self organization. It is absolutely essential that the Chinese Communist Party recognize what this means and recognize that Marx was not kidding when he said that the emancipation of the working class could be accomplished only by the working class itself. The role of the Party is NOT to lead the class_ not tell the class what to do_ not become the State. As an old comrade of mine_ Noel Ignatiev wrote: _The task of revolutionaries is not to organize the workers but to organize themselves to discover those patterns of activity and forms of organization that have sprung up out of the struggle and that embody the new society_ and to help them grow stronger_ more confident_ and more conscious of their direction.___http://oreaddaily.blogspot.com/2012/09/china-foxconn-workers-doing-it-for.html	2012-09-26T21:49:07+0000	2	1	3
