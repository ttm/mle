109971182359978_589225961101162	photo	Dear All___ __This is sad to inform you all that I had a terrible motorcycle accident that led to the breaking of my right hand.  This sad event took place last Sunday evening on my way to one of our Ghettos Outreach Campaign site. My hand got broken with my bone shooting out. I was rushed to the hospital to seek medical attention. Presently I am at a renowned herbalist hospital where I am going to be for the next 2month until my hand gets better. __Please see attached photos of my broken hand. I am also posting a video recording of the accident on face book.__ __Best regards_	2013-04-27T16:55:17+0000	2	0	2

The town of Cupertino is now called _Chinatino_ among realtors. The huge influx of Chinese investors will price out locals and totally change the local demographics since the China investment wave is just beginning_ thus the importance of connecting with CINA.org.  Investors from the BRICs and other emerging nations are coming since the U.S. is growing and still the safest investment spot.

The ensuing parade of calamities will include ”melting polar ice caps_ rising sea levels_ collapsing coral reefs_ extreme weather events_ desertification and fresh water shortages_ famine and mass migration and_ conceivably_ violent conflict”. __＃２：Nuclear Proliferation._Things are slightly better when it comes to nuclear proliferation – the greatest near-term threat to global security. Today_ there are only nine known nuclear powers. But we could be approaching a tipping point. The ongoing defiance by North Korea and Iran_ Pakistan’s growing nuclear arsenal_ the spread of dual-use technology_ and glacial progress towards nuclear disarmament are all eroding the foundations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. __# 3 : Global Health_Things are similarly mixed when it comes to advancing global health. First the good news: in recent years the world has showered unprecedented attention and resources on global health initiatives. New public-private initiatives have sprung up_ involving not only sovereign governments and formal bodies like the World Health Organization but also private corporations_ and philanthropies like the Gates Foundation.__*six big challenges: global warming_ nuclear proliferation_ violent conflict_ global health_ transnational terrorism_ and financial instability.

I collect $2000 cash upfront_ go to the parts store to buy the parts_ assemble it in my dorm and ship it to students/students on the UT Austin campus.  There are 50_000 students at UT and all of them need a PC._  __WHEN - how much progress have you made?  demos?  __WHO - customers?  payments?  partners? __Keep it short_ punchy_ visual (if possible with products or demos_ which are better than slides)_ and memorable.  The listener should be able to repeat it 30 years later like Dell_s pitch to me.	2013-04-19T17:36:09+0000	1	4	5

Solution: make sure at least half of venture policymakers are women and half under 30 years of age (i.e. 25% young women_ 25% young men_ 25% older women_ 25% older men).  Then venture policies will better reflect society.
